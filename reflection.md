Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

Which methods did you decide to overload, and why?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Methods overloaded: I only overloaded constructor methods for each class (Library, Cafe, House).
Why: I didn't see the point of overloading other methods. Most param is necessary and becomes useless if hard coded. 

For kudos, it is feasible to downcast the building object selected in the ArrayList, though I am wondering whether there are any other ways to program it.
